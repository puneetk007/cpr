Losing excess weight has become a challenge for people. They are willing to do anything and everything to shed stubborn body fat that hangs around their arms, legs, belly and love handles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weight loss industry has become one of the top-grossing markets because of people's obsession to look lean and slim. Every day we come to know about some extraordinary diet or a fantastic exercise regime that will melt the fat like butter on a hot pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, the fact is, even with so many resources and information, people are unable to lose weight permanently. Sure, these programs help them lose weight once, but as soon as they follow their normal regime, all that weight comes back, plus a little more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to understand that these markets are duping you with fake products and information about weight loss.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what's the permanent solution for weight loss you may ask?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Morgan Hurst, the root cause of weight gain is leptin resistance. Therefore, he joined hands with scientists and researchers to create Leptitox as the permanent solution for weight gain and obesity.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did all this to save his wife's life from the dangerous complications of obesity. And the best part is, it only takes 5-seconds daily from your life. No need to prepare fancy diets and do extreme workouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LEPTITOX?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Bottle Pack Of Leptitox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox is a blend of 22 natural ingredients extracted from the worlds' most nutrient-rich plants and herbs. It is a dietary supplement that reduces leptin resistance, considered to be the root cause of fat accumulation. (according to www.research.leptitox.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox contains pure and high quality of detoxifying agents and plant extracts compressed in a form of capsules, to be taken once a day with water. (The water hack)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach and every capsule of Leptitox is manufactured in the USA in facilities that are FDA approved and GMP certified. Leptitox capsules are vegetarian, non-GMO, Plant-based and safe to consume. They don't include stimulants or toxins that are habit-forming and are not addictive in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a formula that will in addition to curbing leptin resistance, may also support your heart and brain health, strengthen your joints, boosts your energy levels and much more to improve your overall health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LEPTIN?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptin is our \"starvation hormone\". It is essentially, a protein that's released by the fat cells into our bloodstream. When it reaches the brain it signals that the body has enough energy stored in the fat cells to engage in normal day to day activities.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reaching certain leptin threshold, the brain senses that your body has reached energy sufficiency to burn energy at a normal rate, eat food at a normal amount and can also engage in exercise at a normal or expensive rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut people tend to eat less when they are on a diet. The fat cells then lose some fat and release less leptin. This reduces your personal leptin threshold, which your brain senses and puts your body in a starvation state which initiates several processes in your body to drive leptin levels back up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne such process is stimulating the vagus nerve, which runs between your brain and the abdomen. It is your energy storage nerve and when it turned on, it makes you hungrier. It is designed to take up extra energy (the food you eat) and store it in fat cells (making you fat). To re-establish the leptin threshold to where it belongs, it causes you to eat more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LEPTIN RESISTANCE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople produce leptin in proportion to their sizes and since obese people's fat cells store higher amounts of fat, the amount of leptin they produce is also relatively higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven how leptin is supposed to work, the obese population should naturally limit the amount of food they consume. In other words, their brains should already know that they have enough energy stored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it might be possible, their leptin signaling has stopped working although there is plenty of leptin present, the brain might not register it. This condition is termed as Leptin resistance and is considered to be one of the main biological contributors to obesity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes the brain to think erroneously that your body is starving even though more than enough energy is stored. This causes the brain to change its behavior and triggers the following responses in order to regain body fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEating more: In order to prevent starvation, your brain thinks that you should eat more.\r\nReduced energy expenditure: your brain starts burning less energy in your resting period in order to conserve more energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus leptin resistance which is a hormonal defect is the underlying cause of the weight gain. Eating more and exercising less as suggested by conventional advice does not make much sense here when it comes to weight gain. The people with leptin-resistance have a hard time overcoming the leptin-driven starvation signals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CAUSES LEPTIN RESISTANCE\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several potential mechanisms that may cause leptin resistance. These are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation: One of the important causes of leptin resistance in humans is inflammation in your hypothalamus\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree fatty acids: Presence of free fatty acids in your brain may interfere with leptin signaling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving high leptin: Elevated levels of leptin also causes leptin resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObesity amplifies most of these factors, hence you might get entrapped in a vicious cycle of weight gain and become increasingly leptin resistant over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrastic changes in our environmental conditions and due to the pollution, our environment is filled with toxic chemicals and harmful entities. These chemicals listed below also cause leptin resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBPA (Bisphenol A) \u2013 BPA is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that is found all over the world in cans of food, plastic, sports drink etc. On contact, they wreak havoc on the delicate functions of your body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTBT (Tributyltin) \u2013 Another EDC that is found in paints, vinyl, and pesticides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) \u2013 Found in Teflon cookware is the most common type of EDC\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that the level of EDC is directly proportional to how much weight you gain. These chemicals, on entering your bloodstream disrupt your brain from detecting leptin thus making you eat more food that leads to obesity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending upon our body type, we all are affected by EDCs at different rates. Department of Neuroscience in Ontario, Canada did a study where they found out that higher amounts of BPA led to leptin resistance where the subjects were never able to suppress their hunger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES LEPTITOX WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox is a blend of several powerful plant extracts that research suggests contains powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory ingredients that naturally improve your leptin resistance to normal levels. This, in turn, lowers the levels of various EDCs we studied earlier.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, it attacks the root cause of weight gain i.e. leptin resistance, so that your brain functions properly and gives your body the right signals of when to stop eating. This makes sure that you're not getting more than enough energy in your system and hence not storing the excess energy in your fat cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obese people, regular use of leptitox will first make you feel satiated for longer durations of time. So that the energy requirements are met by burning fats that are already stored in your body, thus making you leaner day by day. Then it will maintain your leptin threshold so that you are able to maintain your leaner look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS IN LEPTITOX THAT COUNTERS EDCs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan Hurst has created Leptitox from 22 powerful plant extracts that are naturally occurring in the environment and have absolutely zero side effects. Let us have a look-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarian Thistle \u2013 It helps detoxifying BPA, a powerful endocrine-disrupting chemical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApium Graveolens Seeds \u2013 Helps in detoxifying an EDC called DEHP which is found in nearly all plastics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJujube \u2013 It helps in detoxifying the endocrine disrupter, ZEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrape Seed \u2013\u00a0 Helps in cleansing harmful EDC cadmium, found in nuts, vegetables, and cereals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa \u2013 Heals the liver and replenishes vitamins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanca piedra \u2013 it is enriched with antioxidants that support healthy kidney functions and digestive system. It improves your body's inflammatory responses and detoxifies various EDCs present in your body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaraxacum Leaves \u2013 it protects your bone health as it is high in vitamin K. In addition, it also cleanses the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrassicas \u2013 it is a type of broccoli enriched in cysteine which is needed to make a powerful antioxidant called glutathione.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarberry \u2013 it prevents fat storage and supports healthy cholesterol levels which in turn helps improve your brain health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 other secret ingredients which you will come to about after you pass the checkout area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan's team has also added some of their own clinically researched powerful antioxidants which include.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nn-acetylcysteine, burdock root, choline, chicory root, methionine, feverfew and 4 more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these ingredients are blended together in such proportions to provide maximum results in terms of reducing leptin resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox is a 100% natural and consumer-friendly dietary supplement that tackles the problem of leptin resistance in obese people.\r\nThe ingredients used to manufacture Leptitox are clinically proven to be exhibiting effective antioxidative functions.\r\nIt has no side effects and its daily use is completely risk-free.\r\nIt improves energy levels and makes you leaner day by day.\r\nYou can eat your favorite foods and still lose weight.\r\nIt comes with a 60-days money-back guarantee, no questions asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is available for purchase online only.\r\nSince every individual is unique, the results may vary from person to person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR VERDICT &amp; RATINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have given LEPTITOX high ratings of 4.8 out of 5.

Losing excess weight has become a challenge for people. They are willing to do anything and everything to shed stubborn body fat that hangs around their arms, legs, belly and love handles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weight loss industry has become one of the top-grossing markets because of people's obsession to look lean and slim. Every day we come to know about some extraordinary diet or a fantastic exercise regime that will melt the fat like butter on a hot pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, the fact is, even with so many resources and information, people are unable to lose weight permanently. Sure, these programs help them lose weight once, but as soon as they follow their normal regime, all that weight comes back, plus a little more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to understand that these markets are duping you with fake products and information about weight loss.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what's the permanent solution for weight loss you may ask?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Morgan Hurst, the root cause of weight gain is leptin resistance. Therefore, he joined hands with scientists and researchers to create Leptitox as the permanent solution for weight gain and obesity.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did all this to save his wife's life from the dangerous complications of obesity. And the best part is, it only takes 5-seconds daily from your life. No need to prepare fancy diets and do extreme workouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LEPTITOX?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree Bottle Pack Of Leptitox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox is a blend of 22 natural ingredients extracted from the worlds' most nutrient-rich plants and herbs. It is a dietary supplement that reduces leptin resistance, considered to be the root cause of fat accumulation. (according to www.research.leptitox.com)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox contains pure and high quality of detoxifying agents and plant extracts compressed in a form of capsules, to be taken once a day with water. (The water hack)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach and every capsule of Leptitox is manufactured in the USA in facilities that are FDA approved and GMP certified. Leptitox capsules are vegetarian, non-GMO, Plant-based and safe to consume. They don't include stimulants or toxins that are habit-forming and are not addictive in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a formula that will in addition to curbing leptin resistance, may also support your heart and brain health, strengthen your joints, boosts your energy levels and much more to improve your overall health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LEPTIN?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptin is our \"starvation hormone\". It is essentially, a protein that's released by the fat cells into our bloodstream. When it reaches the brain it signals that the body has enough energy stored in the fat cells to engage in normal day to day activities.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reaching certain leptin threshold, the brain senses that your body has reached energy sufficiency to burn energy at a normal rate, eat food at a normal amount and can also engage in exercise at a normal or expensive rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut people tend to eat less when they are on a diet. The fat cells then lose some fat and release less leptin. This reduces your personal leptin threshold, which your brain senses and puts your body in a starvation state which initiates several processes in your body to drive leptin levels back up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne such process is stimulating the vagus nerve, which runs between your brain and the abdomen. It is your energy storage nerve and when it turned on, it makes you hungrier. It is designed to take up extra energy (the food you eat) and store it in fat cells (making you fat). To re-establish the leptin threshold to where it belongs, it causes you to eat more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LEPTIN RESISTANCE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople produce leptin in proportion to their sizes and since obese people's fat cells store higher amounts of fat, the amount of leptin they produce is also relatively higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven how leptin is supposed to work, the obese population should naturally limit the amount of food they consume. In other words, their brains should already know that they have enough energy stored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it might be possible, their leptin signaling has stopped working although there is plenty of leptin present, the brain might not register it. This condition is termed as Leptin resistance and is considered to be one of the main biological contributors to obesity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis makes the brain to think erroneously that your body is starving even though more than enough energy is stored. This causes the brain to change its behavior and triggers the following responses in order to regain body fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEating more: In order to prevent starvation, your brain thinks that you should eat more.\r\nReduced energy expenditure: your brain starts burning less energy in your resting period in order to conserve more energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus leptin resistance which is a hormonal defect is the underlying cause of the weight gain. Eating more and exercising less as suggested by conventional advice does not make much sense here when it comes to weight gain. The people with leptin-resistance have a hard time overcoming the leptin-driven starvation signals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CAUSES LEPTIN RESISTANCE\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several potential mechanisms that may cause leptin resistance. These are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation: One of the important causes of leptin resistance in humans is inflammation in your hypothalamus\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree fatty acids: Presence of free fatty acids in your brain may interfere with leptin signaling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving high leptin: Elevated levels of leptin also causes leptin resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObesity amplifies most of these factors, hence you might get entrapped in a vicious cycle of weight gain and become increasingly leptin resistant over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrastic changes in our environmental conditions and due to the pollution, our environment is filled with toxic chemicals and harmful entities. These chemicals listed below also cause leptin resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBPA (Bisphenol A) \u2013 BPA is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that is found all over the world in cans of food, plastic, sports drink etc. On contact, they wreak havoc on the delicate functions of your body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTBT (Tributyltin) \u2013 Another EDC that is found in paints, vinyl, and pesticides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) \u2013 Found in Teflon cookware is the most common type of EDC\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that the level of EDC is directly proportional to how much weight you gain. These chemicals, on entering your bloodstream disrupt your brain from detecting leptin thus making you eat more food that leads to obesity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending upon our body type, we all are affected by EDCs at different rates. Department of Neuroscience in Ontario, Canada did a study where they found out that higher amounts of BPA led to leptin resistance where the subjects were never able to suppress their hunger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES LEPTITOX WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox is a blend of several powerful plant extracts that research suggests contains powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory ingredients that naturally improve your leptin resistance to normal levels. This, in turn, lowers the levels of various EDCs we studied earlier.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, it attacks the root cause of weight gain i.e. leptin resistance, so that your brain functions properly and gives your body the right signals of when to stop eating. This makes sure that you're not getting more than enough energy in your system and hence not storing the excess energy in your fat cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obese people, regular use of leptitox will first make you feel satiated for longer durations of time. So that the energy requirements are met by burning fats that are already stored in your body, thus making you leaner day by day. Then it will maintain your leptin threshold so that you are able to maintain your leaner look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS IN LEPTITOX THAT COUNTERS EDCs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan Hurst has created Leptitox from 22 powerful plant extracts that are naturally occurring in the environment and have absolutely zero side effects. Let us have a look-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarian Thistle \u2013 It helps detoxifying BPA, a powerful endocrine-disrupting chemical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApium Graveolens Seeds \u2013 Helps in detoxifying an EDC called DEHP which is found in nearly all plastics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJujube \u2013 It helps in detoxifying the endocrine disrupter, ZEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrape Seed \u2013\u00a0 Helps in cleansing harmful EDC cadmium, found in nuts, vegetables, and cereals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfalfa \u2013 Heals the liver and replenishes vitamins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanca piedra \u2013 it is enriched with antioxidants that support healthy kidney functions and digestive system. It improves your body's inflammatory responses and detoxifies various EDCs present in your body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaraxacum Leaves \u2013 it protects your bone health as it is high in vitamin K. In addition, it also cleanses the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrassicas \u2013 it is a type of broccoli enriched in cysteine which is needed to make a powerful antioxidant called glutathione.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarberry \u2013 it prevents fat storage and supports healthy cholesterol levels which in turn helps improve your brain health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 other secret ingredients which you will come to about after you pass the checkout area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan's team has also added some of their own clinically researched powerful antioxidants which include.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nn-acetylcysteine, burdock root, choline, chicory root, methionine, feverfew and 4 more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these ingredients are blended together in such proportions to provide maximum results in terms of reducing leptin resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptitox is a 100% natural and consumer-friendly dietary supplement that tackles the problem of leptin resistance in obese people.\r\nThe ingredients used to manufacture Leptitox are clinically proven to be exhibiting effective antioxidative functions.\r\nIt has no side effects and its daily use is completely risk-free.\r\nIt improves energy levels and makes you leaner day by day.\r\nYou can eat your favorite foods and still lose weight.\r\nIt comes with a 60-days money-back guarantee, no questions asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is available for purchase online only.\r\nSince every individual is unique, the results may vary from person to person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR VERDICT &amp; RATINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have given LEPTITOX high ratings of 4.8 out of 5.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>



<p>Obesity has struck millions of people like an epidemic. Losing excess weight has become a challenge for people. They are willing to do anything and everything to<strong> shed stubborn body fat </strong>that hangs around their arms, legs, belly and love handles.</p>



<p>The weight loss industry has become one of the top-grossing markets because of people&#8217;s obsession to<strong> look lean and slim</strong>. Every day we come to know about some extraordinary diet or a fantastic exercise regime that will <em>melt the fat like butter</em> on a hot pan.</p>



<p>But, the fact is, even with so many resources and information, people are unable to <strong>lose weight permanently</strong>. Sure, these programs help them lose weight once, but as soon as they follow their normal regime, all that weight comes back, plus a little more.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not hard to understand that these markets are duping you with fake products and information about weight loss. </p>



<p>So what&#8217;s the <strong>permanent solution for weight loss</strong> you may ask?</p>



<p>According to Morgan Hurst, the <strong>root cause of weight gain is leptin resistance</strong>. Therefore, he joined hands with scientists and researchers to create Leptitox as the<em> permanent solution for weight gain</em> and obesity. </p>



<p>He did all this to save his wife&#8217;s life from the dangerous complications of obesity. And the best part is, it only takes 5-seconds daily from your life. No need to prepare fancy diets and do extreme workouts.</p>



<h2>WHAT IS LEPTITOX?</h2>

</div>



<p>Leptitox is a <strong>blend of 22 natural ingredients</strong> extracted from the worlds&#8217; most nutrient-rich plants and herbs. It is a dietary supplement that reduces leptin resistance, considered to be the root cause of fat accumulation. (according to www.research.leptitox.com)</p>



<p>Leptitox contains pure and high quality of detoxifying agents and plant extracts compressed in a form of capsules, to be taken once a day with water. (The water hack)</p>



<p>Each and every capsule of Leptitox is <strong>manufactured in the USA in facilities that are FDA approved and GMP certified</strong>. Leptitox capsules are vegetarian, non-GMO, Plant-based and safe to consume. They don&#8217;t include stimulants or toxins that are habit-forming and are not addictive in nature.</p>



<p>It is a formula that will in addition to<strong> curbing leptin resistance</strong>, may also support your heart and brain health, strengthen your joints, boosts your energy levels and much more to improve your overall health.</p>



<h2>WHAT IS LEPTIN?</h2>



<p>Leptin is our <strong>&#8220;starvation hormone&#8221;</strong>. It is essentially, a protein that&#8217;s released by the fat cells into our bloodstream. When it reaches the brain it signals that the body has enough energy stored in the fat cells to engage in normal day to day activities. </p>



<p>On reaching certain <strong>leptin threshold</strong>, the brain senses that your body has reached energy sufficiency to burn energy at a normal rate, eat food at a normal amount and can also engage in exercise at a normal or expensive rate.</p>



<p>But people tend to eat less when they are on a diet. The fat cells then <strong>lose some fat</strong> and release less leptin. This <strong>reduces your personal leptin threshold</strong>, which your brain senses and puts your body in a starvation state which initiates several processes in your body to drive leptin levels back up.</p>



<p>One such process is<strong> stimulating the vagus nerve</strong>, which runs between your brain and the abdomen. It is your energy storage nerve and when it turned on, it makes you hungrier. It is designed to take up extra energy (the food you eat) and store it in fat cells (making you fat). To re-establish the leptin threshold to where it belongs, it causes you to eat more.</p>



<h2>WHAT IS LEPTIN RESISTANCE?</h2>



<p>People produce leptin in proportion to their sizes and since obese people&#8217;s fat cells store higher amounts of fat, the amount of leptin they produce is also relatively higher.</p>



<p>Given how leptin is supposed to work, the obese population should naturally limit the amount of food they consume. In other words, their brains should already know that they have enough energy stored.</p>



<p>But it might be possible, their leptin signaling has stopped working although there is plenty of leptin present, the brain might not register it. This condition is termed as<strong> Leptin resistance </strong>and is considered to be one of the <strong>main biological contributors to obesity.</strong></p>



<p>This makes the brain to think erroneously that your body is starving even though more than enough energy is stored. This causes the brain to change its behavior and triggers the following responses in order to regain body fat.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Eating more:</strong> In order to prevent starvation, your brain thinks that you should eat more.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced energy expenditure:</strong> your brain starts burning less energy in your resting period in order to conserve more energy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Thus leptin resistance which is a hormonal defect is the <strong>underlying cause of the weight gain</strong>. Eating more and exercising less as suggested by conventional advice does not make much sense here when it comes to weight gain. The people with leptin-resistance have a hard time overcoming the leptin-driven starvation signals.</p>



<h2>WHAT CAUSES LEPTIN RESISTANCE </h2>



<p>There are several potential mechanisms that may cause leptin resistance. These are</p>



<p><strong>Inflammation: </strong>One of the important causes of leptin resistance in humans is inflammation in your hypothalamus </p>



<p><strong>Free fatty acids:</strong> Presence of free fatty acids in your brain may interfere with leptin signaling.</p>



<p><strong>Having high leptin:</strong> Elevated levels of leptin also causes leptin resistance.</p>



<p>Obesity amplifies most of these factors, hence you might get entrapped in a <strong>vicious cycle of weight gain</strong> and become increasingly leptin resistant over time.</p>



<p>Drastic changes in our environmental conditions and due to the pollution, our environment is filled with toxic chemicals and harmful entities. These chemicals listed below also cause leptin resistance.</p>



<p><strong>BPA (Bisphenol A)</strong> – BPA is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that is found all over the world in cans of food, plastic, sports drink etc. On contact, they wreak havoc on the delicate functions of your body.</p>



<p><strong>TBT (Tributyltin) – Another EDC that is found in paints, vinyl, </strong>and pesticides.</p>



<p><strong>PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid)</strong> – Found in Teflon cookware is the most common type of EDC </p>



<p>Research has shown that the level of EDC is directly proportional to how much weight you gain. These chemicals, on entering your bloodstream<strong> disrupt your brain from detecting leptin</strong> thus making you eat more food that leads to obesity.</p>



<p>Depending upon our body type, we all are affected by EDCs at different rates. <strong>Department of Neuroscience in Ontario, Canada did a study where they found out that higher amounts of BPA led to leptin resistance where the subjects were never able to suppress their hunger</strong></p>



<h2>HOW DOES LEPTITOX WORKS</h2>



<p>Leptitox is a blend of several powerful plant extracts that research suggests contains powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory ingredients that <strong>naturally improve your leptin resistance</strong> to normal levels. This, in turn, lowers the levels of various EDCs we studied earlier. </p>



<p>Thus, it attacks the<strong> root cause of weight gain i.e. leptin resistance</strong>, so that your brain functions properly and gives your body the right signals of when to stop eating. This makes sure that you&#8217;re not getting more than enough energy in your system and hence not storing the excess energy in your fat cells.</p>



<p>In obese people, regular use of leptitox will first make you feel satiated for longer durations of time. So that the energy requirements are met by <strong>burning fats </strong>that are already stored in your body, thus <strong>making you leaner day by day</strong>. Then it will maintain your leptin threshold so that you are able to maintain your leaner look.</p>



<h2>INGREDIENTS IN LEPTITOX THAT COUNTERS EDCs</h2>



<p>Morgan Hurst has created Leptitox from 22 powerful plant extracts that are naturally occurring in the environment and have absolutely zero side effects. Let us have a look-</p>



<p><strong>Marian Thistle</strong> – It helps detoxifying BPA, a powerful endocrine-disrupting chemical.</p>



<p><strong>Apium Graveolens Seeds</strong> – Helps in detoxifying an EDC called DEHP which is found in nearly all plastics</p>



<p><strong>Jujube</strong> – It helps in detoxifying the endocrine disrupter, ZEA.</p>



<p><strong>Grape Seed</strong> –  Helps in cleansing harmful EDC cadmium, found in nuts, vegetables, and cereals.</p>



<p><strong>Alfalfa</strong> – Heals the liver and replenishes vitamins.</p>



<p><strong>Chanca piedra</strong> – it is enriched with antioxidants that support healthy kidney functions and digestive system. It improves your body&#8217;s inflammatory responses and detoxifies various EDCs present in your body.</p>
